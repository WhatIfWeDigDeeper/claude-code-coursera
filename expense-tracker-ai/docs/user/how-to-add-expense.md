**What to do**:
1. Click on the date field

**Tips**:

### Step 2: Enter the Amount

Enter how much you spent (without the dollar sign).

**What to do**:
1. Click in the "Amount" field
2. Type the number (e.g., `45.99` or `12.50`)
3. Don't include the $ symbol - just the number

**Tips**:
- Use decimals for cents (12.50, not 12.5)
- The app prevents you from entering $0 or negative numbers
- You can use amounts like 1234.56 for larger purchases

**Common mistake to avoid**:
- ❌ Don't type "$45.99" - just type "45.99"

### Step 3: Choose a Category

Select the category that best matches your expense.

   - **Transport** - Gas, bus fare, Uber, parking
   - **Entertainment** - Movies, games, hobbies
   - **Utilities** - Electric, water, internet bills
   - **Healthcare** - Doctor visits, medicine, insurance
   - **Other** - Anything that doesn't fit above

**Tips**:
- When in doubt, use "Other"
- The default is "Food" since it's commonly used
- Categories help you see spending patterns in the Dashboard

### Step 4: Add a Description

Write a short note about what the expense was for.

- This field is required - can't be left empty

**Common mistake to avoid**:
- ❌ Don't just type spaces - write an actual description

### Step 5: Save the Expense

## Tips and Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Add expenses regularly** - Try to add them daily so you don't forget

- **Check your entries** - Review the expense list to catch mistakes early
- **Edit mistakes immediately** - Don't wait to fix errors

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't forget the cents** - Use 12.50 instead of 12 for accuracy
- **Don't leave fields empty** - All fields except date are required
- **Don't use the wrong category** - Your analytics will be off

### Pro Tips 💡

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Amount must be greater than 0" error

**Symptoms**: Red error message appears below the Amount field

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you entered a number
2. Check that the number is greater than 0
3. Remove any dollar signs ($) or commas (,)
4. Use format like: 45.99 or 12.50

**Why it happens**: The app requires positive amounts to prevent data entry errors

---

### Problem: "Description is required" error

**Symptoms**: Red error message appears below the Description field

**Solution**:
1. Type something in the description field
2. Don't just type spaces - write actual text
3. Example: "Coffee at Starbucks"

**Why it happens**: Expenses need descriptions to be meaningful and searchable

---

### Problem: Form won't save / Nothing happens when I click Add

**Symptoms**: Button click doesn't do anything

**Solution**:
1. Check all fields for red error messages
2. Make sure date field has a value
3. Verify amount is a number greater than 0
4. Ensure description isn't empty
5. Fix any errors and try again

**Why it happens**: The form validates all fields before saving

---

### Problem: Can't exit edit mode

**Symptoms**: Form is stuck showing an expense's data

**Solution**:
1. Click the "Cancel" button below the "Update Expense" button
2. This returns the form to normal "Add" mode
3. The form clears and is ready for new entries

**Why it happens**: Edit mode stays active until you save or cancel

---

### Problem: Decimal amounts aren't working

**Symptoms**: Can't enter cents, only whole dollars

**Solution**:
1. Use a period (.) not a comma (,) for decimals
2. Format: 12.50 ✅ not 12,50 ❌
3. This is standard US number formatting

**Why it happens**: The app expects decimal points, not commas
