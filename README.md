## Module 1 Scaling Up Software Engineering with Claude Code & Generative AI

Like having a team of 1,000 developers

> Write a complete Nextjs + NextUI web application for tracking expenses. When you are done, start it for me to test.

### 1000X Improvement in Software Engineering Productivity with Big Prompts

Stop micromanaging AI by using it to write functions and individual files. By taking the human out of the detailed loop, AI is able to scale up. Give instructions like given to a CPU.

Imagine your manager sitting down and telling you I want you to create a `component/expense_list.tsx`.

> Act like the typical user of this application, then create different ways of sorting, filtering, and displaying the expenses.

Doing the equivalent of zooming out. Human doing higher order critical thinking.

With the model of giving individual tasks like create a function in this file, then "you are the bottleneck. You limit the scalability."

> This will require 100s or more iterations and inputs from you to build an application.
