## Exercise: From Coffee-Stained Napkin to Production Code with Multimodal Prompting

Can give it an image and a prompt like

```md
I sketched an expense insights dashboard on a napkin at a coffee shop.
Please implement this as a React component called MonthlyInsights.

Looking at this sketch: /imgs/napkin-insights-mockup.png

Implement a new screen in the application that mirrors what you see in the mockup.
```

A picture is worth a thousand tokens.
